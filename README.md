## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the work for Assignment 2 (Basics of Linux and Open-Source Tools). [cite_start]The goal was to demonstrate practical knowledge of Linux by installing an OS (WSL/Ubuntu), documenting 20+ shell commands, and developing three functional shell scripts to automate common tasks[cite: 782, 783, 785].

## 2. Scripts Included

[cite_start]This project includes three main scripts as required[cite: 803]:

* [cite_start]**`backup_directory.sh`**: A script that backs up a specified directory to a new location with a timestamp[cite: 804, 805].
* **`cpu_memory_monitor.sh`**: A script that monitors and logs CPU and memory usage to a file at regular intervals[cite: 806, 807].
* [cite_start]**`automated_download.sh`**: A script that downloads a file from a URL using `wget` or `curl`[cite: 808, 809].

## 3. Instructions for Running the Scripts

To run these scripts, you must first make them executable.

### Step 1: Make Scripts Executable

Run this command for each script:

```bash
chmod +x backup_directory.sh
chmod +x cpu_memomry_monitor.sh
chmod +x automated_download.sh
